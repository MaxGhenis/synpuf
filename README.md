Synthetic PUF

Repository in relation to constructing a fully synthetic PUF database from the actual PUF. (Public Use File -- from the IRS Statistics of Income branch.) Purpose is to allow interested OSPC members to communicate about issues and methods for constructing a fully synthetic PUF. We will not have any confidential or non-releasable data on this site.

Interested OSPC members are likely to include @andersonfrailey, @feenberg, @MaxGhenis, and @MattHJensen.

I've set this up in my github user account for now but we can transfer it to an OSPC account whenever that makes sense.
